						 Rule of 72
				</b>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="what">
			Whenever a beginner starts investing the first question he tends to ask is the time required to double the investment. This time required to double the investment is calculated using the rule of 72 which requires a definite and fixed rate of interest. You can divide the rate of return by 72 to get an approximate value of return on investment. Let us understand with an example, suppose you are investing Rs 500,000 at the rate of 8%. So 72/8 = 9 i.e. it will take 9 years for your investment to double.
